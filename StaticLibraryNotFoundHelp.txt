if you can't get g++ to compile when your dynamic library is in the
  /usr/local/lib/ folder as the library cannot be found by the linker then try 
  running the following command and rebooting your system
this will tell the linker that it should look in /usr/local/lib/ for
  dynamic libraries which it is not currently doing if it can not find the 
  library even though you know that the library is there and functioning 
  (likely compiles using a makefile but not in g++)

sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
